Mnemonic is a canceled project.

The IOS app store rejected it due to lack of functionality, I personally enjoy it and use it occasionally.

The app converts images into secure passwords. Never forget a password, just remember what image is associated with the account.

For example, while not very secure your Facebook password could be your facebook profile picture.

Inspired by 1995 film "Johnny Mnemonic".
