Mnemonic is a cancled project.

The IOS app store rejected it due to lack of functionaility, I personally enjoy it and use it occasionally.

The APP converts images into secure passwords. Never forget a password, just rember what image is assocated with the account. 

For example, while not very secure your Facebook password could be your facebook profile picture.

Inspired by 1995 film "Johnny Mnemonic".
